이 채널의 무대는 내 가족의 거실이며, 동시에 거리와 광장입니다.
<br>
This channel takes place in my family living room, as well as public sites.
<br><br>
이 채널은 솔직하고 개인적이지만, 동시에 허구이며 철저히 익명입니다.
<br>
It is private, honest, painstakingly anonymous and fictional at the same time.
<br><br>
무엇보다도 이 채널에서 나는 어디에도 속하지 못한 나의 목소리를 찾고 나누기를 바랍니다.
<br>
Above all, I am here to share my voice that couldn't belong to any places.
<br><br>
나는 야심한 시간에 당신을 만나러 옵니다,
<br>
I come here to meet you at late time,
<br><br>
내 몸이 관통해 온 다양한 장소와 시간으로부터.
<br>
from the moments and spaces my body has been through.
<br><br>
나는 이곳과 저곳 사이에서 끊임없이 무언가를 가리키고 있어요.
<br>
I am in between here and there, constantly pointing at something.
