how can we talk about the missing in the room

do we put the room into the space we share

or do we put ourselves outside

when we are outside<br>
then we should think about how to reach inside again<br>
do we do it with robotic dogs?<br>
or do we do it through layers of concrete<br>
enhanced with infra red vision<br>
from a satellite in orbit<br>
into our old inside

what was it we did by telling you we were outside?

i think i left the kettle on, the cats not been fed<br>
save it Iâ€™ve called an airstrike

all that you see before you will be reduced to the ground.<br>
splintered concrete iron rods still sticking out<br>
they hadnt even finished building the house.

and we bombed it

not flat no
left it standing partially<br>
bits of the roof<br>
bits of the stairs

all their clothes and bits of _you know_ everywhere<br>
that way itll take them longer to rebuild

not really flat at all<br>
dont you remember what the peace we told you was like?<br>
_you know_ all over the place over there

bombed it from the sky<br>
because we decided that it would be better if it was like that<br>
and we have these

so _you know_

how can we talk about the missing in the room

do we put the room into the space we share

or do we put ourselves outside

because a wall is a door through which a people enters

and gets turned into the worst kind of thing.
