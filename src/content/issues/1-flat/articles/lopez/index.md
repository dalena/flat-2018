# 1. Signaling Noise
### Themes: soundscape, sound pollution, urban design, data visualization, body-space relationship, <br>costume software.

Originally installed as a 3 channel video installation, Signaling Noise LA captures the Los Angeles city sites where sound becomes noise. In the past year, I’ve become interested in recording sound and how space shapes sound and vice versa. When realizing that most of my sound data collected in that year was of city noise, I began to record footage of those sites with the aim to focus on sound as space. Signaling Noise LA is rethinking the urban landscape in terms of spatial acoustics, while the city architecture has an effect on the sound environment, the noise disruption that is generated is often unnoticed. Viewing noise as space becomes a prominent idea in this work, the costume software reinforces that idea by distorts each frame depending on the sound frequency of its city site, visually disrupting the image through noise. The sound for Signaling Noise LA was created by merging different city sounds and  a melody based on patterns that were found within them. Then, it was separated into 3 different audio sources, creating a correlation to the vision source. Once the sound was done, it was processed into the first of two softwarws. The first software analyzed and exported the FFT of each sound piece into a text file. Then I used the second software to distort the pixels frlm each frame based on the FFT information that the first software generated. The aim for this process was to generate a visual quality that symbolizes the noise of such site.

# 2. Hidden Numbers
### Themes: pollution, data visualization.

The web is a means of communication and thus a way of expressing current state of events; with the help of digital sources we’re able to receive data endlessly. Most of those sources make use of machine learning algorithms to enhance our interaction with people from all around the globe, creating a sustainable virtual ecosystem. However, our information is not solely virtual, mass data is stored in warehouses called data centers. Major corporations fail to address the negative environmental impact that these data centers have by making their locations anonymous. The servers used to store data requires an exponential amount of energy and cooling power, which contributes to our carbon dioxide footprint. The portrayal of the web as an eco-friendly space free of waste is inaccurate, Hidden Numbers is aiming to address such environmental issues that most aren’t aware of yet all participate in. Through generative visual poetry and textured sounds, Hidden Numbers is referencing the conflict that exists with our virtual interactions. By demystifying the medium, which is the web, one can conclude that such sustainable environment also stores virtual waste. Hidden Numbers aims to create awareness of our virtual and physical print that is caused by our sharing of information.

# 3. Reuse by Design
### Themes: ecology, upcycling fashion.

This project exists as a book and as a photo series, it is addressing the environmental impact that consumerist culture has had, where fast fashion is a daily routine, pushing us to produce more waste. Furthermore, this project is an attempt to explore how design could contribute to a re-imagination of speculative wearable design by reusing one’s trash. The focus on wearable design is inspired by the exponential growth of fast fashion and it is one of the primary polluters. Putting myself as an example, for a week I listed the amount of trash I consumed and created a dataset of each individual product. After analyzing my week’s worth of trash, it led me to rethink my relationship with materials. By exploring the functionality of my trash, I shifted from ordinary use to more creative and authentic ones.

# 4. Spatial Disintegration
### Themes: brutalism, body-space relationships, generative design  |  <i>++ in progress</i>.

This project is about the shifting perceptions of our body-space relationships. I am using the brutalist framework as a base for my project being that it has a history of contradiction, the original philosophy was socialism, which then sci-fi films borrowed their structures as an icon to represent totalitarianism. This same shift of perception comes in the types of agencies people have (or not) with space and structures. For the visualization of this concept, I am filming dancers cohabit in public spaces that surround brutalist structures. Those dancers will be performing a set of lmb (laban movement analysis) movements, which comes from their awareness of their body in such space, the (repetitive) imitation of others that also exist in that space and their personal relationship with the spatial qualities that surround them. These videos will exist in a generative software that randomizes the videos in a way that the audience will never see the same sequence. The software will also distort the image (procedurally) with the aim to emphasize on our shifting perceptions of space and how that has an impact on the structure, conceptually and sometimes physically.
