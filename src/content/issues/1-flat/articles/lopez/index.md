This project is about the shifting perceptions of our body-space relationships. I am using the brutalist framework as a base for my project being that it has a history of contradiction, the original philosophy was socialism, which then sci-fi films borrowed their structures as an icon to represent totalitarianism. This same shift of perception comes in the types of agencies people have (or not) with space and structures. For the visualization of this concept, I am filming dancers cohabit in public spaces that surround brutalist structures. Those dancers will be performing a set of lmb (laban movement analysis) movements, which comes from their awareness of their body in such space, the (repetitive) imitation of others that also exist in that space and their personal relationship with the spatial qualities that surround them. These videos will exist in a generative software that randomizes the videos in a way that the audience will never see the same sequence. The software will also distort the image (procedurally) with the aim to emphasize on our shifting perceptions of space and how that has an impact on the structure, conceptually and sometimes physically.
