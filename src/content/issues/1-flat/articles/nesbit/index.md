artistBio: "Mike Nesbit is an LA-based fine artist who likes to produce work through community engagement within and outside California. Nesbit’s ability to engage local museums, institutions, design organizations, and media outlets allows his ambitious artworks to become collaborative realities, transforming his art into objects that contain a sense of shared pride and ownership with the communities involved in their manufacturing and maintenance.<br />
<br />
With a background in architecture, his multidisciplinary skill-set greatly informs his artwork, allowing Nesbit to bridge the worlds of art and architecture with a focus on technique, repetition, and space. Nesbit has participated in solo and group shows across the country. His long-term installation FLOOD in Omaha, NE, recently won the 2018 IIDA Great Plains Chapter Interior Design Excellence Award, the 2018 ACI Nebraska Award of Outstanding Achievement, and the 2018 national PCI Award for Industry Advancement. Furthermore, Nesbit was selected to be a featured artist for the JW Marriott’s documentary series on Downtown L.A. culture.<br />
<br />
His current large-scale sculptural exhibit THE BLUES is on view at The Black Contemporary in Ames, Iowa until April 2019. He received a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the Southern California Institute of Architecture in Los Angeles and worked closely with Thom Mayne of Morphosis for five years, recently completing Mayne’s personal home as his project Architect. Previous, to Art and Architecture Nesbit, played professional baseball with the Seattle Mariners."

Phlatness is a series of drawings that I’ve been producing over the past 5 years.  There is a collage of techniques used in the work (analog and digital) with an intent of representation of representation.  A hand drawing is produced representing an object and then a digital drawing is produced of the hand drawing instead of the original object.  The assembly line of this iterative drawing process is intended to remove or flatten any meaning tied to the original object and allow the representation to move forward and be judged at “face-value”.  The Digital drawings are then printed through an analog process of offset lithography where repetition and iteration are used to further enhance the intent of that process.  Along with the drawings there is an Abstract Technical description of the “Phlatness Theory” intended to be broken down to its basic terms to understand the judgement behind the work.
