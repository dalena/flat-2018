*The Delay* is a five-part narrative about the lives of four characters who each are confronted with their relationship to time, identity, and media. Sang, a bitter librarian and part-time gambler with a questionable diet, collapses with the onset of a fatal but curable disease. Nour, Sang's granddaughter and self-proclaimed entrepreneur finds a way to turn an episode of grief into a chance to be a part of a greater plan. A couple, with nothing to lose and a whole lot of money, commit themselves to a barren form of nostalgia to satiate their burnt out romance.
