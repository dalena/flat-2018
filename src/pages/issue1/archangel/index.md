most electronic components are built economy what is your exposure I mean from the manufacturers making this up as we go how do you keep the books I don't know what what sort of and that's really the nightmare were sort of making it up and literally everyone else in the business is doing the same thing at the moment I'm in the

you're listening to Marketplace on WNYC all coming up next day 2
 this is Marketplace on, Rachel Hartman tickets to Toledo Ohio yesterday, Auto industry today billion dollars of government money remember to Chrysler GM GMAC protect millions of years after the financial crisis today he goes to Kenosha Wisconsin a city with a long and proud tradition of automobile production that come to an end but we're halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee Michigan Kenosha Wisconsin what are the First Assembly Plant the year ahead of Henry Ford's Union organized before
 until 2010 or 1988 Chrysler Chrysler engine plant shutdown with November 1st of 2010 and the federal government and a lot of endangered Auto plants across the Midwest Kenosha say engine plant for a while there
 but yet Kenosha pulled out will you turn something bad into a positive end up with money from Chrysler and now it's Harbor Park with a vintage electric trolley cleaning round style Setter it's public access to the lakefront to Boardwalk Marina is president of the Kenosha area commuters we've seen a tremendous amount of residential development the economy has become more diverse 3.3% poverty and median household income comprable to levels Nationwide
 all pints North and now it's attracted distribution centers in logistics facilities Advanced manufacturing operations food processing companies like Amazon to SC Johnson Products company says the region has attracted new jobs to replace those in the auto plants this is growing up forever young adult president of UAW Local 72 in Kenosha which mostly looks and remembers when her daughter and son-in-law were starting out I went over to the office and I see if this isn't going to be a job for a long-term don't hire him it would have been nice
 if there was this here but it isn't it isn't there no more is just the first step in Kenosha Street development been torn down
 a place where they roll up the sidewalks at exactly happened either now though and many billions of dollars later after dark and a lot of them happen at a place called LA Live restaurant bars the Microsoft theater on the Emmy Awards hotels in Staples Center lot going on so the other day we went for a walk and talk with the place and all or part of its tenants sports teams to use including the Staples Center which is where we started our walk in and was like before all the building started
 it was 1998 we broke ground on Staples Center this was not the best part of the city when you look around today me see these buildings popping up all around us it's become so much more than that it's it's still the business center in the financial center but it's also the sports and entertainment center it's the culinary center it's the cultural center in a lot of different ways it's a place where people come at night and we also focused on what we're good at so we are not residential developers when I retail developers so what we seeing a lot of these projects not just here in Downtown LA but other projects is other developers coming in in and putting their capital and building these other pieces of it and that's kind of a rewarding a rewarding part of it and we focus on our core in a way you were betting on the come right
 that's obviously but it's not just about what cities are going to it's about places in the city that need economic so we can we go in the East Berlin on the market as opposed to just the market itself was no time at all in this economy to be opening some giant billion dollar investment I don't think that any business in the world is recession-proof but I'll tell you the lesson that we learned coming out of two thousand seven eight nine is that our business in a lot of ways is recession-resistant and I think it's because of the nature of sports and entertainment and that we have great assets whether it's the O2 in London or Staples
 for the galaxies there are so this is this was not built when Staples Center opened their Microsoft Microsoft theater 7000 seats so we wanted to be able to capitalize on a lot of infrastructure that we had at Staple Center we have a whole bunch of Staff do we need to build all of that again with this new 7000 seat venue across the street or is there somewhere where we can connect to the infrastructure that we had we built this tunnel which enables us you come in here on any given Friday or Saturday when we have events going at Fulton Center
 this is a buzzing Corridor with people and staff and beverage going underneath the house is home sweet home tonight so any any moment now we'll have the visiting team probably doing their shoot around it so this is the Time of the Season where we'll do 240 events a year and this is the season where a lot of them happen there's a lot of compression in the schedule it's a need this campus Wells funny when you think back in 1997 when I started we were back at the at the Forum in Inglewood in the market we're really all they were all built in the in the 60s and the Endocet
 so there was there was a real hole in the market for a state-of-the-art venue you look at the markets around the country every Market had a state-of-the-art venue in some a lot less or markets in Los Angeles so I think that was the division for AG started was with the acquisition of the LA Kings back in 1995 and this Vision to build an arena in downtown Los Angeles what is your car running a global company with global Brands what are you worried about
 well I think about macros things I think about micro sings now we're 28,000 employees over 200 venues all over the world so at any given moment right now there's an event going on somewhere within a show with all of those events going on I said I think a lot about Safety and Security you know it's an extremely high priority on the macro side again I think about the economy what do you think about making sure we are you know it's the expansion is long in the tooth and you run a company that depends a lot on discretionary income what's your what's your economic stress level one of the Lessons Learned is that in many ways we are rzeszut recession-resistant not recession-proof but still we're investing a lot of capital invested so we have to be careful and selective with the risks that we we're always going to be a growing company are our company is growing every year we'd set records and revenue and growth in the last six years with the economy we have to be careful but there is also opportunity that comes
 with the with some of the economic distress or or operates change the LA Galaxy and in Major League Soccer also has a slice of the Lakers you got a favor
 I love all my children come on I'm passionate and and our fans know they see me at every game they know that I'm just passionate as they are about the team it's also have a vested interest in making sure that our teams are successful so in addition to it being rewarding for us to be at the games and and watch us when it's also good for a business when we're successful so I do I do love them all
 I still think he's got a feeling I'm just saying look at ticket sales at Staples the cost of a seat for a Laker game and a Clippers game check it out marketplace.org
 Amazon conundrum in Reverse Amy was telling us about how Amazon's Tech worker pipeline offering a ten-thousand-dollar relocation package with a catch get a $500 monthly stipend $1,500 bonus at the end of 12 months and other stuff as well but you can't actually tell so you have to be employed someplace else just got to live in Tulsa has to get economic growth
