The short column introduces my new web-based project that I hope to share on the DMA X Journal website.  

Both under construction, launch in the end of April.

My art practice has been motivated by the irreconcilable gap between images, desires and bodies. Here, the images are not only visual productions but also mental ones that define one’s aspirations, as well as a sense of identity. My works deals with the issues of representation inherent in patriarchal and consumerist culture from the perspective of a woman through repurposing media culture, forms of digital technologies and performances. 

Working with video and performance, I have been invested in the idea of screens. In my works, “the screens” move beyond flat surfaces serving as both actual and metaphorical sites of mediation among desiring human subjects. They range from those found in television, personal blogs, to a fragment of a dress or to seductive gestures. The screens are site where we are represented under restrictions but also where we present ourselves with passion. They are like mirrors of ourselves, but also a projection of the others at the same time. Holding the controversies of presentation vs representation, I am intrigued by the potentiality of “the screens” as sites of inquiry and resistance.  

My upcoming project Channel Green House is a virtual platform; a website and a YouTube streaming channel, where I turn my body into a “screen” in my family living room.  
On this web channel, I periodically present a series of live-stream performance videos that take places in the living room while other family members are away or asleep. I wear chromakey costume and perform spontaneously with daily objects and custom made chromakey objects. On the chromakeyed part, the footages from my online or outside activities, as well as performances at different times are overlapped. The superimposed footages often reflect my contradictory relationship to family background, such as myself protesting in public squares for women’s right issue or anti-eviction. In the work, my existence covered in green and the green objects that I play with become “holes” in my living room. They are “holes” cut out towards the “outside world” enabled through a virtual space.  

 To provide a subtext of the project, I live in an apartment complex with my grandmother and parents where most residents are upper middle-class families. These apartment complexes have strong implication of pro-capitalist and heteronormative life style that could be compared to suburban gated communities representing “American dream”. They are also deeply related to the force of gentrification in Korea, often causing social problems such as eviction and destruction of historical neighborhoods during the processes of their constructions. Staging my performance in the living room that obviously shows the architectural structure of an apartment complex is an attempt to implicate these issues in my performance video. 

Through the performance I hope to communicate a sense of loneliness, guilt, irony, and resistance that comes from occupying conflicting positions at the same time without fully belonging anywhere, especially related to my current situation of financial dependency and paradoxical relationship to patriarchy. However, I do not see this contradiction as a personal problem, but rather as a socioeconomical phenomenon when artists can barely make a living and pursue their careers without being dependent on some kind of capital (often from their families). The title Green House literally refers to the chromakey color employed in the performance, at the same time expresses the sarcasm about an environment that is sanitized from the outside world.  
 
With an attempt to touch upon larger social issues, I present myself as an anonymous figure covered in green mask and costume without any indication of my personal identity. The audience will only have hints of who I am through the location of performance (living room), superimposed images (protest sites), and my comments. I hope to make this performance platform less about the actual person behind the camera, but the character who takes shape through the audiences’ assumptions and expectations. The performer covered in chromakey invites people under similar circumstances or emotional status to identify themselves to the character. I am intrigued by the limits and potentiality of “screen body” in the post-internet era, where one’s body as well as identity seem to fluctuate on the surface. Initiated as an attempt to express my agency at home, I hope this project raises complex questions about one’s identity in the digital age: how can one’s ‘multifaceted-ness’ manifest in the flat world? Can we have an ontological presence in the screen?
