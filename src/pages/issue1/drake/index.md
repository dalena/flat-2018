For the inaugural issue of X Journal, Iâ€™d like to interview linguistic anthropologist David Valentine about his current research of the commercial NewSpace community. Coined in 2006, the term NewSpace has been deployed to brand an eclectic group of mostly US-based space enthusiasts, tech entrepreneurs, former NASA employees, etc. who advocate for the privatization of access to outer space and venture to make humanity multi-planetary in hopes of saving our species in the advent of ecological collapse, nuclear annihilation, or the inevitable death of our sun. For NewSpace supporters, free market capitalism is celebrated as the best guarantor of this future, arguing that human settlement in space is the "next step" in human evolution itself. 

For Valentine, the extreme desire to leave the flat experience of the Earth's surface endeavored towards by the NewSpace community opens up new points of difference for rethinking the category of the human through non-terrestrial sites.
