2018 October 22 

Dear Sayak, I wonder what you mean when you write that, 

I am interested in the structural implications of your writing — about what you mean by de- construction, masculine, gender — but as I write this, I also wonder, what would you think about Chase Strangio’s appearance on Democracy Now! this morning? I don’t know if it was his deconstruction, his masculinity, or his gender, but his appearance made me feel possible on a day when the news was disorganizing. He made my friend Daniel cry. I wonder what you would think about the three of us, and whether our self-criticality is radical enough. 

I’m sitting in the back of the Solís lecture hall with the other Diversity Teaching Assistants. The class is called Diversity — Dimensions of Culture I: Diversity, the first of a three-course sequence in fulfillment of the University’s college writing program. The professor is introduc- ing Kimberlé Crenshaw’s writing about intersectionality, setting up the idea that gender is a social construction that interacts with and complicates categories of race. She’s emphasizing that Crenshaw’s work comes out of that same moment of 90s identity politics that Omi and Winant’s theory of racial formations also comes out of. Our students had to read that last week. War on Drugs, she says, Anita Hill, Clarence Thomas. I scan two hundred backs of eighteen- and nineteen-year-old heads. I just listened to Chase Strangio’s interview on De- mocracy Now!, responding to the New York Times report that President Trump is proposing a legal definition of gender based on the genitals people are born with, and I am waiting for the professor to acknowledge the news. She doesn’t, but I feel it wash over the room. 

Chase appears on Democracy Now! as both attorney and witness, disaffected survivor. Repre- senting the ACLU and Chelsea Manning and himself, he testifies to the fear and threats we are facing now, and to a long history of trans resistance.1 He explains that The New York Times is part of the problem. 

I walk to the lecture hall through a sea of undergraduate students on skateboards and am aware of adjusting my pace so as not to collide. I’m thinking about all of the ways that I’ve “We must exercise caution as we engage in the deconstruction of the masculine gender. We cannot approach this work with foolish optimism, since we have to keep in mind that the deconstruction of hegemonic masculinity might lead us to construct new masculinities that end up being neither new nor desirable... the outcome can be unpredictable and dys-

The New York Times was incorrect in saying that the Obama administration, quote-unquote, ‘loosened’ the definition of gender or sex. That is not what happened. The law has been clear for decades. The Obama adminis-

made him cry too. Daniel thinks he cried because of Chase’s affect — which he identifies as an “isolation of affect: speaking about intense things while sounding detached.”2 Remi doesn’t tell me why it makes him cry, but says that he loves Chase. [...] I have long been very critical of The New York Times’ trans coverage. And that’s true of yesterday’s article, as well. I think it was an incendiary headline designed to get clicks. It absolutely is true that trans people are under attack, but the idea that trans people’s existence is up for debate is precisely the paradigm that The New York Times has fueled over

come out in the wrong order. Anyway, there is nothing straight about feeling and there is nothing straight about time. Especially legal time.3 

While the professor talks about Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas, I look around the room. None of our students were alive in the 90s. I feel like they already know about intersection- ality, that they have already internalized this on some level, but I wonder if I feel that way because I privately regard them as trans. I know it’s not fair of me to assume. Daniel tells me he does the same thing with his students, imagines they’re all trans.
